            <strong>Types of Data Collected: </strong>Nearthy collects the
            following types of data, which are stored locally on your device. We

            <br /><br /><strong>- Name (Required): </strong>We ask for your name

            optional. <br /><br /><strong
              >- Contact Information (Only 1 required): </strong
            >You may choose to provide your phone number and/or Instagram
            username. You can provide one or both of these, depending on your
            preferences. <br /><br /><strong

            <strong>How Data is Provided: </strong>Your data is provided to
            Nearthy during the creation of your user profile. The details you
            provide, including your name, profile picture, bio, and contact
            information (phone number and/or Instagram username), are
            voluntarily submitted by you when setting up your profile within the
            Nearthy app. <br />
            Additionally, Nearthy may request permission to access your device's
            location for specific features, such as connecting with other
            devices via Bluetooth. This location data is solely used for the
            intended purpose and is not retained beyond the immediate use case.

            <strong>Purpose of Data Collection: </strong>Nearthy needs you to
            provide some information for its functionality. Nearthy can only
            work correctly if everybody has provided the required information.
            This information is essential for users to connect and interact with
            each other using Nearthy's nearby sharing features.
          </p>
          <br />
        </li>
        <li class="list-el">
          <p class="text">
            <strong>Data Usage and Sharing: </strong>Nearthy exclusively uses
            your data to facilitate its core functionality, which is connecting
            you with nearby individuals. Here's how data usage and sharing work:
            <br /><br />
            <strong>- Service Activation: </strong>When you activate the Nearthy
            service within the app, Nearthy initiates a search for nearby
            individuals who have also activated the service. Only when a match
            is found will your data be shared. <br /><br />
            <strong>- Basic Information Sharing: </strong> Upon finding a match,
            Nearthy shares some information with the nearby user, including your
            name and profile picture. Simultaneously, you receive the same basic
            information from the other user and it can be seen on your main
            screen. <br /><br />
            <strong>- Request and Expanded Information Sharing: </strong>Once
            this basic information is visible on your main screen, you have the
            option to send or accept requests to and from other users. When a
            request is accepted, both users can see each other's full profile
            information, including name, profile picture (if provided), bio (if
            provided), and any contact information (Instagram username and/or
            phone number) the user has chosen to share. Also, Nearthy allows you
            to chat with the users while they are connected.<br /><br /><strong
              >Note: </strong
            >When a request is accepted and profiles are shared, the profiles
            will also be saved locally on each other's devices. This can be
            useful for the user and it also allows Nearthy to ignore users you
            have already met so you don't get useless notifications.<br /><br />
            Nearthy does not use your data for any purposes other than
            connecting you with nearby users and enhancing your interactions
            within the app. We do not share your data with third parties outside
            the scope of the app's functionality.

            <strong>User Control: </strong>Nearthy offers you control over your
            data and interactions within the app. Here's how you can manage your
            information: <br /><br />
            <strong>- Your Profile Information: </strong>Nearthy allows you to
            view and edit the information of your profile.<br /><br />
            <strong>- Data Deletion: </strong>You have full control over your
            data because it is stored in your device. You have the option to
            delete saved profiles individually within the app. This means you
            can remove profiles that you have interacted with and saved for
            future reference. You can also delete all your information from
            Nearthy in the device settings.

            <strong>Data Security: </strong>Nearthy prioritizes the security of
            your data. We want to assure you that we take advantage of the
            security measures provided by the Nearby Share functionality to
            safeguard your information. Nearby Share includes robust security
            features designed to protect data during sharing and interactions
            within the app. <br /><br />
            While we do not implement additional security measures beyond those
            provided by Nearby Share, we want to emphasize that your data
            security is of utmost importance to us. We continually monitor and
            update our app to ensure it aligns with the latest security
            practices and standards. <br /><br />Rest assured that we are
            committed to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your
            data as you use Nearthy.

            <strong>Data Retention: </strong>Nearthy retains user data to ensure
            the functionality of the app. Here's how data retention works:
            <br /><br /><strong>- Profile Information: </strong> Your profile
            information, including your name, profile picture, bio, and contact
            information, is stored on your device. You have the option to edit
            this information from the app, or delete all your information at any
            time from your app settings.<br /><br /><strong>
              - Saved Profiles:
            </strong>
            Profiles of other users you have interacted with and saved for
            future reference will be retained on your device. You can delete
            these profiles individually from inside the app. <br /><br /><strong
              >- Chat Conversations: </strong
            >Chat messages and conversations are stored on your device to
            facilitate ongoing interactions with other users. Please note that
            Nearthy currently offers the option to delete all data, including
            chat conversations, from the app settings. Individual chat message
            deletion is not available at this time. <br /><br /><strong
              >- Location Data: </strong
            >Nearthy may request permission to access your device's location for
            connecting with other devices via Bluetooth. Location data is not
            stored beyond the immediate use case and is not retained by the
            app.<br /><br />
            Please be aware that when you choose to delete data from your device
            through the app settings, it will result in the removal of all data.
            Nearthy is committed to respecting your privacy, and our data
            retention practices are designed to align with your preferences and
            the app's functionality.
